<p>I suppose being pedantic is what being a programmer is all about. 
That being said, I am surprised by the number of negative comments 
received. The author (in all fairness) indicated:</p><p>1. 
role-based-access-control in the title - nothing about best practices, 
patterns or OO principles, which really would do little for the audience
 of the article, except convolute and complicate the content for 
beginners.</p><p>2. Intermediate is the target audience.</p><p>I think 
some of you have focused on the wrong details. Nothing wrong with 
playing devils advocate, but a little humility, appreciation and common 
sense would help. :)</p><p>Regards,<br>Alex</p>

<p>Here are my suggestions.<br>Add an `updated` column as a timestamp. 
"`updated` timestamp NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE 
CURRENT_TIMESTAMP". This will allow for simple 'auditing' and also will 
jive better with some DB classes so they can tell if something has been 
updated.</p><p>Permissions table: Add a "perm_key" as a varchar(30) w/ 
an index so you can do something like "$user-&gt;hasPermission('Open 
Door');"; instead of having to look it up by id.</p><p>role_perm and 
user_perm tables: Add a `value` column that as a boolean (tinyint(1)). 
You can use this to be more "fine grained" in permission setting.</p><p>Add a table called 'user_perm' to links to users to individual permissions allowing for more "fine grained" permissions.</p><p>If
 you are looking for speed in a larger system, you could create another 
table that could be called `user_compiled_perm`. This would link user 
ids to permission ids that the user would have, which is what it looks 
like you are doing now.</p>

<p>I note in your brief bio that you are self-taught. You really should 
take some time to study software development patterns, as you have 
grossly over-complicated what should be a perfunctory, low-overhead 
task.<br>   I know this is only an example... But it is a really, really bad one.<br>
   Since you wanted specifics from another gentleman, here's one to 
think about: It's silly to use joins in an RBAC table when you can 
accomplish the exact same role multiplicity by using to parameters per 
user: roles (a text word) and values (a scalar quantity).<br>   Database joins slow things down right when you don't want to slow things down: at page load.</p>

<p>Hi everyone:<br>I might sound ignorant, but... Why use a static 
method to create a instant of the class? Why don't you put the code to 
the constructor and create a instant of the class like $u = new 
class($param); instead? It is just your preference or there is any 
performance gain or maybe a security issue? Enlightens me please, just a
 rookie!</p>

<p>Hi, actually I want to implement this code as a security module into 
my system and I have already a BD with role an permissions tables, also a
 users table that it's working now on production. But I have a question 
about a php file that I need to implement this solution. I read that I 
can copy this two files: Role.php and PrivilegedUser.php but this last 
extends its class of another class called users. I don't have this class
 created into my system, and finally i just want to know what should be 
content of this class so to this example work for me. Thanks</p>

<p>If you know the roles that your application will need to support (and
 its a reasonable number) save yourself alot of work and use the 
Zend_Acl (<a href="http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.acl.html%29" rel="nofollow">http://framework.zend.com/manu...</a>,
 Hard code your roles as objects (e.g user, admin,customer) and just use
 a placeholder table, with numeric key id (class name as a primay key).</p><p>I
 can't recommend it enough to avoid a many to many relation between user
 and role, use a role hierarchy instead and keep the relation sane, zend
 acl can help with that.</p>

<p>This article was great, a good overview of using RBAC in PHP. I was 
looking into ACL lists and as you point out, it was not very elegent to 
control user access permission. I have implemented the RBAC based on 
your article into my new framework and having the ability to create new 
roles and assign them to users and permissions gives the webmaster a lot
 more fine grained control. <br>Cheers ;-)</p>

<p>I agree with Kikloo. There are many basic tutorials on OO PHP but 
they are so brief and the typical "Hello World" style that it does not 
give one a true explanation of how to use OO PHP in a real world 
example. I do hope that the authors here would consider putting together
 a usable tutorial.</p>

<p>Kikloo, this article was actually supposed to be published AFTER an 
introduction to classes, but the author of that article got delayed. 
It's unfortunate because I wrote the article with an introduction in 
mind (I was expecting to make a few revisions), and as a result I can 
imagine it is more difficult to follow.</p><p>I agree with you 
completely, somebody should write an introduction to classes. I don't 
feel confident enough in my OOP knowledge to be the person to do so, 
however. I'm getting ripped apart for using GLOBALS here, but trying to 
do it "the right way" just gave me a big headache (neither $this-&gt;db 
or self::$db can be used in static methods, and passing the $db as a 
parameter feels more ugly than just using GLOBALS to me). I do it this 
way because it's easy and it works, but then people will tell you it's 
wrong. I wish I could help you more and I hope somebody else will step 
up to the challenge.</p>

<p>I agree with Timothy. The main purpose of this article is to 
introduce about Role Based Access Control, how to organize the data. To 
organize a Role Based Access Control, we will have 4 main tables : Role,
 Permission, RolePermission and RoleUser. And we should create a class 
PriviledgeUser extend from User to have a better structure in code. And 
depending on each framework, we will have our own implementation.</p><p>Thanks Martin Psinas for your article</p>

<p>The point of this article is to introduce someone who may not have 
been acquainted with RBAC before, and to highlight some of the things 
he/she would need to consider when adding it to an existing 
non-framework-based application. I don't want to detract from the 
original intent of the article.</p><p>With that said, I've always viewed
 PHPMaster as a site not exclusively for “masters,” but also for 
beginners starting on their journey to “masterhood.” I think there is 
merit in having articles that target all skill levels. Perhaps what may 
be missing is a better identification/organization scheme, which I and 
the other editors will need to discuss.</p><p>I do appreciate everyone 
who has taken the time to point out problems with this and other 
articles. The authors and I do our best, but occasionally mistakes 
happen. Sometimes it's a typo or a missing image, other times it's 
$GLOBALS. We're not perfect, and it's good to see the community helping 
keep us all honest! The important thing is that we all remain polite 
when such situations arise. Regardless of who it comes from, 
snark/arrogance begets defensiveness which degrades the conversation 
rather quickly instead of creating an opportunity to learn and share 
with each other.</p>

<p>I'm a little perplexed by the fetchAll(), then explicitly only grabbing the $result[0].<br>If
 you're only expecting one row, use fetch().  If you actually have more 
than one result row, it's probably an error condition that should be 
dealt with, as it likely violates some logical constraint that your app 
relies on.</p>

<p>Perfectly fine comment, a phpmaster knows why they shouldn't use $GLOBALS. I'm disappointed by sitepoint and <a href="http://phpmasters.com/" rel="nofollow">phpmasters.com</a>.
 This is the second example of poor coding I've seen on this site in the
 past couple days. I'd imagine fewer oversites from a site proclaiming 
to be masters. I think posting articles with easily fixed issues like 
this leads to the questioning of the credibility of other posts. It 
endangers the site of becoming another phpclasses.</p>

<p>As readers, we should exercise our fingers to point out issues and 
offer suggestion so we don't end up with coders releasing code that is 
not sound. If the issues are corrected with a note about the correction 
within the article, I think we can forgive the authors, unlike some site
 where you have to dig through pages of comments to find fixes and

<p>The dependencies of your class should be visible from the outside. I 
don't want to open your file and read through the source to find which 
objects i have to write to the registry ($GLOBALS) before I can use your
 class. IoC should be the way to go - inject the dependencies through 
setter or constructor injection into your class. 
__construct(DbAdapterInterface $adapter) { } would be much more elegant.</p>
